Room was so small and they charge me 50 dollar.
Parking was a problem and very expensive.
"the staircase is a bit old and dusty where works are taking place and scaffolding all over the front of the hotel... like I said, not a massive deal"
You have to pay extra for wifi every 24hrs.
I got told off at the roof top bar for sitting in the wrong area by the security.The room was tiny.
No WiFi in hotel unless you were prepared to pay well over the odds!
Nowadays the internet should be for free everywhere.

Next to Balthazar for a delicious breakfast
Very unfriendly staff at reception: not responding to needs and giving wrong information.
"The staff are polite, chatty and very helpful."
"Although clean and the bed comfy, the room was a little on the small side."
And best of all was the location!
"Wi-Fi sporadic, very slow connection."
Carpets in the hall and rug in the room was dirty.
"Within walking distance of the Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park and grand central was just around the corner if you prefer to take a train or subway."
"The rooms are extremely small, practically only a bed."
Mattress very comfortable.
No breakfast offered.
It was very convenient.
Staff were miserable.
No bathroom in room
The entire bed smelled gross and had really cheap blankets.
Restaurant staff are much better than the hotel ones.
The bed was soooo comfy.
Front desk stuff was not really friendly and apparently she didn't like her work at all.
Beds are comfortable and air conditioning is working well
Very close to Times Square
"Very well located, modern, large and clean rooms."

"Buffet breakfast very good, kept us going until evening"
"Very spacious rooms, quiet and very comfortable."
Lights in the common room were too dim.
Air conditioning working fine.
I stayed 5 more days with the same bad smell.
"For the relatively fit, it is also walking distance to Times Square/5th Avenue etc."
Bad attitude like he didn't want to be there.
"location, nice quiet comfortable room, great wifi, excellent free buffet breakfast"
Missed having a fridge or breakfast on site
Location is brilliant - a block and a half from Grand Central Station.
About a 5 block walk from Grand Central where you can access many subway lines.
"Very close to the subway, easy to find."
"Terrible, small cubbyholes, which are marketed as rooms."
Our room was facing the back of another office building.
Great price for a solo business traveler.
Everyone at this hotel was wonderful to work with.
The gym was very small and basic
"The mattresses were too ""springy"" and uncomfortable."
Made it really easy to get anywhere within a short time.
We were upgraded.

Room wasn't cleaned or bed made up
"Clean rooms, genial desk service, very personal experience overall."
Close to Times Square.
It is near two subway stations: Grand St and Bowery St

There were not vending machines that worked.
"The heat in the room fluctuated -- at times it felt a little draft, and on my last night, the fan was really loud."
"The position of the hotel is perfect - 20mt  from the Subway (C,E) and one block from the red line."
"The building was under renovation,"
"Perfect breakfast, great start for the day."
"This hotel suits more for business trips rather than for tourists, because Downtown is too far from the most attractions of Manhattan."
Room too small to open suitcase.
"Almost everything - price reasonable for location, perfectly located - terrific staff."
no elevator might be a challenge for some people
Got bitten by bedbugs.
We received a $100 a night discount when we complained.
I had to ask for it and got just 60 dollars discount.
The location was excellent and the price was amazing.
The TV was not working.
Hallways to room stale and didn't feel clean.
staff will bring luggage up.
They seem to have a gender bias as i only see men working at the reception every time i visit the hotel!
Hot water was abundant and the A/C (window unit) was ice cold - Excellent!
Breakfast was delicious each morning!
Bar has a great atmosphere and serves delicious food.
Internet should be free--really not good.
I was also overcharged for dry cleaning.
"given this is New York and it is reasonably priced, I think that is fair enough!"
There's also a subway station right outside the hotel and plenty of places to eat and shop.
Anything we needed was just there or a phone call away.
Cosmo was made the right way at all other restaurants and lounges during our stay
"we liked very much the location, also the staff."
Location & price - unbeatable in Manhattan

Lack of complimentary tea or coffee.

"But, that breakfast, while good, was obscenely overpriced."
The price reasonable.

"Lobby is super load and i had a cockroach encounter in my room, gross."
The top of the window was then covered by the dirty blind.

"Location was superb, excellent little items like complementary wine/cheese & breakfast was good."
"this was expected, clean towels and room cleaned every day."

Cafeteria was great and they make good food
We enjoyed drinks on the patio of the hotel.
"cleanliness, the amenities in the bathroom with make-up mirror, tile and marble."

However the restaurant downstairs served good food at reasonable prices.

"I was charged for this hotel even though I canceled 4,days prior to arriving."
"Location, evening reception in the Reading Room, friendly and efficient staff, rooftop bar, restaurant downstairs."
"Internet in the room - doesn't matter how the hotel management justifies this, paying for a BASIC amenity like internet these days is ridiculous."
The floor was not very clean.
We all agreed we would like to see a meat option like sausage at the breakfast.
even a great rate in NYC isn't cheap!
My room was immaculate and smelled so fresh and clean.
"Super nice staff, very clean , bed was super comfortable , nice view , good location ."
But fare to say only of the few hotels with free breakfast
The price is too expensive

the bathroom was a little dirty with hair at the walls

"Elevators a problem - took minutes to get one - all staff were using them, making them busy."
Staff was very friendly and the room and hotel were very clean.
Given the size of the rooms I did think it was expensive.
"Room was a little older, could use an update and was expensive."
The construction and street noise were disruptive.
"The free wine and cheese was none too shabby, either."
Considering the prices of the drinks this could be added.
I would not think the price is reasonable for the tiny room.
"Great value for money and perfect location, with a fine restaurant attached."
The Wifi didn't work.
"no spotless,did not refresh coffee and tea bags daily, plastic cups"
The Wifi was not free and 15$ per night

Location; comfort of bed; clean; quite; opposite zuma restaurant; good internet service (used to be slow before); good selection for breakfast; most of staff are kind & helpful...
The cleanliness of the room was ok. 24hr desk is great.
free WiFi in lobby.
I'm an early riser and I would have liked to relax in the lobby with some coffee.
No breakfast included in a $550 room is ridiculous.
"Reasonably clean, friendly service."
"They have a terrific free wine and cheese each evening, which means meeting the owners and other guests."
Elevator was crowded and the wifi signal is weak
Location and cleanliness are excellent!
Good value for money and friendly staff.
"Staff were friendly and accommodating, and the wi-fi signal was exceptionally strong!"
Responsiveness of cleaning staff - toiletries were not replenished regularly.
"The staff were friendly and the facilities were great - wifi, PC and printer, free tea and coffee."
WiFi was not freely available and was at a daily charge.
I was also overcharged; when ask member of stuff to explain they just blamed their colleague for miscalculation and weren't that apologetic.
"The staff are what make this hotel, especially the waitress who served us breakfast each morning and the waiter on duty in the evenings."
For a 5 star hotel that is a very cheap way to treat customers.

It was a bad experience.

loved the roof terrace and the area ...the cleaning staff are amazing so polite .... the tea and coffee was good .....but it was sad to see such a beautiful  lounge and rooftop wasted and empty ..
"Service with a smile. Although in China town, it is still in Manhattan. Free and not slow wifi."
For 3 people in a bedroom the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable
My daughter and myself enjoyed the food at the restaurant ( located conveniently at the hotel.)
"Although rooms are not big, they are clean and comfortable."
"no any view ( a wall ), noisy, air conditioned noisy, internet connection access very poor, the concierge is not there always, breakfast included very poor."
Overall restaurant experience was disappointing.
it wasn't even that cheap!
Staff were very polite and friendly. Room was clean and tidy. Excellent location
We had the most iconic view of the Manhattan skyline in every room.
Friendly staff. Relatively clean (a little bit of dust on the small  coffer). Fair price.
Hotel self service laundry. More space than many NY hotels. Very clean. Very friendly staff.
Surely this is against health and safety regulations?.
"Room is exactly what I expected, bathroom was nicely modern and very clean!"
"1. staff at the front desk were not friendly. 2, food (room service) was horrific and not edible at all."
"We thought that it might be best if there was a separate lift for the staff and cleaning service to use, however, this wasnât a huge issue."
Breakfast included. Happy hour. Neat and clean upon arrival to room. Coffee available all day with flavored creamers at lobby location. Good location within city
Everything I needed. Cafe was great and reasonable pricing. The elevator system (new to me). I did not eat the donuts.
"very poor service, extremely unfriendly , arrogant and not helpful, no customer orientation at all, no minibar in room... i had to wait so long to check in."
"terrible mattress, wires all over smells industrial elevator  etc"
Complimentary breakfast - could not find yogurt or fruit others were eating - not really anyone around to ask.
price of accommodation is over priced for what its worth.
"The High Line is close-by, and there are lots of great shops and restaurants too."
Spacious. Helpful friendly staff
"Location, price, stuff."
Staffs was very friendly. Room was very clean and the towels were like brand new.

The complimentary WiFi.
"Good placed in the city, very close to Times Square and Rockefeller center, good restaurants and bars close to it."
"I enjoyed it because it was clean, quiet, and staff was friendly."
"Easy to access breakfast room, guest rooms and elevators."
noise from subway from Manhattan Bridge (hotel is very close to it; 10 meters maybe); wi-fi sometimes was sometimes wasn't)
"The price was right, we only needed a bed to sleep. Bathroom and showers were clean, room was clean."
